**DISCLAIMER: ** As you embark on your Hackintosh journey you are encouraged to **READ** the entire README and [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/) guides before you start, or check out some [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechNolli) to get an understanding of the install process. It will save many a message instructing you to read the manual. **I am not an expert**, I haven't forced you to do anything, so put on your big boy pants and take responsibility for any mess you get yourself into.

With that said I'm happy to help when/where I can. When you encounter bug or want to improve this repo, consider opening an issue or pull request. You can also find a wealth of knowledge on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/), [TonyMacX86](https://www.tonymacx86.com) or [Google](https://www.google.com).

## Introduction

‚ö†Ô∏è Still issues with Ventura & Sonoma ‚ö†Ô∏è - see `MacOS Selection` below.

<summary><strong>This is not a guide!</strong></summary>


This is not a guide. It shoud only be used as a reference. I provide some tips and tricks I learned on my journey in building a hackintosh. The best way of using this is as a supplement to the OpenCore guide; if you have questions about how to setup your specific hardware, are unclear about what to do, or would like to see the settings I've used.

I understand that some may simply copy the EFI folder to their EFI partition. For clarity the EFI folder needs to go into the EFI partition.

```EFI
EFI (partition)
	EFI
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BOOT
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OC
```

It should work and your ThinkPad L13 Yoga should boot and work fine. **You will at minimum need to generate SMBIOS values if you want Apple services to work.** Note that all error reporting/logging has been turned off in the config.plist. You will have a difficult time trouble shooting with the setup provided. You can easily turn on the error reporting and logging if you follow the Dortania guide. Best of luck.

> **NOTE** if you simply wish to copy my EFI please do the following:
>
> 1. [Generate SMBIOS values](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake-plus.html#nvram) and add them in the config.plist (Use MacBookPro16,3)
> 2. Ensure the value of `showpicker` is  `true` in the config.plist file to provide the opencore menu when booting. 
> 3. Prepare your install [USB](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/)
> 4. Move the entire EFI folder (with your modifications) to the proper partition on your [USB](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#setting-up-opencore-s-efi-environment) (or [hard drive](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/oc2hdd.html) once the install is complete).
> 5. [Install](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#double-checking-your-work) - You'll need to select <kbd>F12</kbd> to get the boot menu options and **boot from the USB each time the computer restarts** until you've copied the EFI folder onto the hard drive. You may also need to select the correct boot option during install.

<summary><strong>Own prev-lang-kbd</strong></summary>



In the config.plist file you set the default language as outlined in the guide. You can either add it as a string or as a hex data using [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)

The setting is found in the config.plist under: 

- NVRAM
  - 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82

Format is lang-COUNTRY:keyboard

- üá∫üá∏ | [0] en_US - U.S --> en-US:0 --> (656e2d55 533a30 in HEX)

| Key           | Type   | Value   |

| prev-lang:kbd | String | en-US:0 |


It is set to English but you can find alternatives here:

<summary><strong>MacOS Selection</strong></summary>




The EFI folder is setup for both Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma. I used `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` values in the config.plist to load the proper kexts based on which OS is being used. **It kinda works with Ventura and Sonoma but there are still some issues:**

1. To use the stylus you need VoodooI2C-v2.6.5 (last version where stylus was working). Unfortunately this creates kernel panics when shutting down or rebooting in Ventura.
2. When shutting down Ventura with VoodooI2C-2.6.5 kexts installed the computer reboots.
3. If you upgrade to newer version of VoodooI2C then Ventura works (touch works with finger) but the stylus doesn't.

> I'm primarily using this EFI with Sonoma 14.2.1 at the moment.

## Post-Install

<details>  
<summary><strong>TrackPad - Disable force touch</strong></summary>


If the **Battery** management **doesn't show up** in the System Preferences after the SSDT-OCBAT1-lenovoPRO13.aml file is added to your ACPI folder and config.plist file. You will not be able to change any trackpad settings. You may experience the annoying behaviour of clicking on the touchpad and it doing a **Force Touch** where the preview of the file is shown. I found this very annoying. You can disable force touch by modifying the file in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad.plist`
Opened it with Propertree and changed **ForceSuppressed** to **True**

Another trick to manage your trackpad, if you can't get the battery to work, is to connect a bluetooth trackpad. Once the bluetooth trackpad is connected you can adjust the settings. Disconnect the bluetooth trackpad and your built in one will maintain those settings.

I used these methods prior to adding the SSDT-OCBAT1-lenovoPRO13.aml from [hagenest/thinkpad-l13-yoga-hackintosh](https://github.com/hagenest/thinkpad-l13-yoga-hackintosh) repo.

<details>  
<summary><strong>Generate your own SMBIOS</strong></summary>
<br>


Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to create your own serial #... based off of your preferred model.

- MacBookPro16,3 -`What I used`

**Note:** If you use a different SMBIOS model than the MacbookPro16,3 that I've used. The provided USB mapping will not work.  You will need to edit the **USBMap.kext file**.  You can right click on the file and select **Show Package Contents**.  From there you can open the Info.plist file in ProperTree and change MacBookPro16,3 to whatever Model ID you've chosen. This should provide a working USBMap.kext.

</details>  

<details>  
<summary><strong>CPUFriend power management</strong></summary>
<br>


Generate `CPUFriendDataProvider` or `ssdt_data.aml` (choose one) for your machine [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend) or use the ssd_data.aml file provided. My files are set for power conservation over performance. Highly recommended that you use power management.



</details>

<details> 
<summary><strong>USB Port Mapping</strong></summary>



While first port mapping I followed the [Dortania guide here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/#macos-and-the-15-port-limit) with USBInjectAll.kext install...  when doing so the internal USB ports did not show up and the cameras, touch screen, and bluetooth did not function. I noticed on the `USBmap tool` screen that RHUB was showing so I Googled it and it brought me back to the [Dortania guide here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/manual/manual.html#special-notes). I added the SSDT-RHUB.aml to the APCI folder rebooted and all the ports showed up. I then mapped the USB ports creating the included USBMap.kext file.



</details>  

<details>  
<summary><strong>Audio Setup</strong></summary>


The L13 Yoga has CX8070 for audio which requires the boot-arg **or** device property below. You can use the boot-args to initially setup your config.plist file as suggested in the guide or simply add the device property. Everything should work, built-in microphone, speakers, headphone jack and microphone. 

NVRAM:

| Key       | Value    |
| --------- | -------- |
| boot-args | alcid=15 |

DeviceProperties

| Key                        | Type       | Value        |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3) | Dictionary |              |
